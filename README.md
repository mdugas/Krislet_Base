# Krislet_Base
Virtual soccer player agent base package

This is a base package prepared for Carleton University's Software Agent course (SYSC5103)

This code is a modified fork of Krzysztof Langner's Krislet code from early 1997. Every person who had their names as people who modified any file within the original code have been put in a [single location](Contributors)

This version of the code has been re-structured using modern standards. Known bugs from [Dr. Babak Esfandiari](@esfandia)'s [known bug list](http://www.sce.carleton.ca/cgi-babak/agentcourse.cgi?KrisletBugs) have also been migrated to the issue tracker on this project. The major change from past version is the changes to the (TeamStart.bat) file to start the code from a JAR file as some students wanted to integrate third-party libraries using their IDE and export the JAR file.

Merge-requests are welcome :)
